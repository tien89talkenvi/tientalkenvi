Note that not all QSEs generate discharges from all/any outfalls the airport has designated for sampling.  Airport discharge locations will be monitored during the 2018-2019 permit year and samples will be collected if a QSE generates a discharge that can be collected for laboratory analyses. Group Leaders will remain in contact with the airport to ensure it is prepared for future QSE sampling.	3	Y	N	N	Y		Y		N		Y	06/01/2018		Y		Greg Owen	27-JUN-18 10.03.43.569000 AM
